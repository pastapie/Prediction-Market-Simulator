        "- **Participant Distribution**: Assumes that 10% of participants are 'strategic', meaning they potentially have better information or models, reflected in their lower variability and smaller biases.\n",
        "- **Biases**:\n",
        "  - Strategic participants have biases uniformly distributed between -0.1 and 0.1, suggesting they are less biased.\n",
        "  - Normal participants have biases uniformly distributed within a wider range (-0.5 to 0.5), indicating greater variability in their judgment or information.\n",
        "- **Standard Deviations**:\n",
        "  - Strategic participants have standard deviations (a measure of prediction variability) uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 0.5, implying more precise predictions.\n",
        "  - Normal participants have standard deviations uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 2, indicating less precision in their predictions.\n",
        "- **Prediction Distribution**: Uses a heavy-tailed t-distribution for generating predictions, which accounts for the likelihood of extreme values more realistically than a normal distribution. The degrees of freedom parameter (set to 5) controls the fatness of the tails.\n",
        "- **Market Consensus**: The market consensus is determined by the median of all predictions, which is robust against outliers and does not disproportionately allow extreme predictions to sway the overall market prediction.\n",
        "- **Error Measurement**: The accuracy of the market is assessed based on whether the absolute difference between the market consensus and the true value is within a specified accuracy threshold (5%).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assumptions in `find_minimum_participants`:\n",
        "- **Statistical Power**: It requires that at least 80% of trials must achieve the desired accuracy to consider the market reliable. This threshold is a common standard in statistics to ensure a high level of confidence in the results.\n",
        "- **Maximum Participants**: Limits the search for the minimum required participants to 5000, implying that the simulation does not explore scenarios with more than 5000 participants.\n",
        "- **Iteration Through Participants**: The function iteratively increases the number of participants from 1 to the maximum specified, simulating the market for each participant count and checking if the desired accuracy is achieved in 80% of trials. This assumes a linear exploration of participant numbers might be sufficient to find the threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Assumptions:\n",
        "- **Independence**: Assumes that each participant's prediction is independent of others', not accounting for potential correlations or information cascades that might occur in real prediction markets.\n",
        "- **Static Parameters**: All parameters (biases, standard deviations, degrees of freedom) are fixed throughout the simulations. It does not account for possible changes in market dynamics over time or under different conditions.\n",
        "- **Uniform Distribution of Parameters**: The choice of uniform distribution for biases and standard deviations assumes equal likelihood of all values within the range, which may not accurately reflect real-world distributions."
